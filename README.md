Tools for converting PalWorld .sav files to JSON and back.

This tool currently supports additional parsing of the following data not handled by `uesave`:

1. `Level.sav`:`GroupSaveDataMap`
    - Groups such as in-game organizations and guilds
1. `Level.sav`:`CharacterSaveParameterMap`
    - Characters such as players and pals

## Converting co-op saves to dedicated server saves

Please follow the instructions provided over at https://github.com/xNul/palworld-host-save-fix

## Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Converting `Level.sav` files to JSON will result in very large files, and may require significant amounts of RAM to process. Use a modern text editor such as Visual Studio Code or a Jetbrains IDE to open these files.

### Prerequisites

1. Python. This can be installed from the Windows Store.

### Windows steps

1. Download the latest release from [https://github.com/cheahjs/palworld-save-tools/releases/latest].
1. Unzip the file into a folder.
1. Drag and drop your `.sav` file (for Steam on Windows, these are located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\<SteamID>\<SaveID>`) onto `convert-single-sav-to-json.bat`.
1. To convert the `.sav.json` file back into a `.sav` file, drag and drop your `.sav.json` file onto `convert-single-json-to-sav.bat`.
